socialQ
=======

SocialQ is a location-based questionary Android application. Our application allows users to post questions and start
discussion based on their current location in a public forum. At its most basic level, the application would show users 
the questions and discussions that are physically nearest to the user. This allows for additional important information 
provided, and increased real-time relevance of answers. At a more structured level, the app is easily scalable to 
allow more in-depth level of questions the user wishes to see. This version is for demonstration only.
